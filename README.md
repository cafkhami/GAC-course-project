##Description of analysis
An analysis of Smartphone Accelerometer data was preformed to extract the mean and standard deviation information out of a much larger dataset.  The training and test data was combined and descriptive labels were given to both the activities preformed as well as the variables recorded.  A subset of those variables was extracted and finally a single table was created to show the averages of those variable subsets for each subject and each activity.  This table is stored in `Tidy.txt`.


The analysis includes the following files:

* `README.md`
* `run_analysis.R`: The R script that actually executes the analysis described above.
* `Tidy.txt`:  The resulting Tidy data set from run_analysis.R
